# Bug Reproduction: Movement Desynchronization
# Steps to reproduce movement sync issues between clients

# Setup test environment with multiple clients
start_server 4443
spawn_clients 3 127.0.0.1 4443

# Test rapid movement updates that might cause desync
client 0 move 100 100
client 0 move 150 120
client 0 move 200 140
client 0 move 250 160
client 0 move 300 180

# Check if all clients see client 0 at the same position
broadcast list_players

# Move another client rapidly
client 1 move 50 200
client 1 move 100 220
client 1 move 150 240
client 1 move 200 260

# Verify positions are synchronized
broadcast list_players

# Expected: All clients should show same positions for each player
# Bug: Clients might show different positions (desync)
