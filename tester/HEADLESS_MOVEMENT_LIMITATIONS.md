# Headless Test Client Movement Limitations

## Summary
After extensive testing, headless Godot test clients can successfully connect to multiplayer servers and become visible players, but **cannot execute movement commands**.

## What Works in Headless Mode ✅
- **Connection**: Successfully connect to multiplayer servers
- **Authentication**: Complete identity exchange and device binding
- **Spawning**: Appear as visible players in the game world  
- **Networking**: Proper peer ID assignment and network sync
- **Camera Detection**: Recognized as "local player" with camera activation

## What Doesn't Work in Headless Mode ❌
- **Input Simulation**: `Input.action_press()` calls don't trigger movement
- **Direct Position Changes**: Setting `player.position` gets overridden
- **Velocity Control**: Setting `player.velocity` doesn't result in movement
- **RPC Movement**: Custom RPC calls for movement don't execute properly
- **Server RPCs**: Using existing `update_player_position` RPC doesn't work

## Technical Details

### Connection Success
```
Successfully connected to server!
Camera enabled for local player: [PEER_ID]
```
- Test clients properly authenticate and spawn
- Assigned unique peer IDs and persistent player IDs
- Visible in server's player list and game world

### Movement Failure Patterns
1. **Input System**: Headless mode doesn't process Input events properly
2. **Physics Authority**: Remote clients can't override server-authoritative movement
3. **Network Sync**: Position/velocity changes get synced away by network updates
4. **RPC Limitations**: Movement RPCs require proper multiplayer authority

### Tested Approaches
1. Input event simulation (`Input.action_press()`)
2. Direct position modification (`player.position = new_pos`)
3. Velocity control (`player.velocity.x = speed`)
4. Custom RPC methods for movement commands
5. Server's existing `update_player_position` RPC
6. Forcing `is_local_player = true` status

**Result**: All approaches failed to produce visible movement

## Solution: Non-Headless Client
To achieve controllable movement, test clients must run with a visible window where:
- Input events can be properly processed
- Physics simulation runs correctly  
- Local player authority is properly established

## Use Cases
**Headless clients are good for:**
- Connection testing
- Server load testing
- Authentication system testing
- Network stability testing
- Player presence simulation

**Headless clients cannot:**
- Demonstrate player movement
- Test gameplay mechanics
- Simulate user input
- Validate movement systems

## Next Steps
Create non-headless test clients for movement testing while keeping headless clients for connection/presence testing.
