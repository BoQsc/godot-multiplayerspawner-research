# Root Cause Investigation: Movement System Failure

## Problem Statement
Test client movement worked once, then completely stopped working despite identical code and server restarts.

## Timeline of Events

### WORKING STATE
- **When**: Early in session
- **Command**: `ImmediateMoveClient.tscn` (foreground)
- **Result**: User confirmed "you moved to the right, that's great"
- **Client Slot**: Low number (< 20)
- **Server**: Fresh restart

### BROKEN STATE  
- **When**: Later in session (current)
- **Command**: Same `ImmediateMoveClient.tscn`
- **Result**: No movement despite successful connection/spawning
- **Client Slot**: 137+ (many attempts)
- **Server**: Multiple restarts attempted

## Confirmed Facts
✅ **Client spawning works** - User can see test clients appear  
✅ **Connection works** - "Successfully connected to server!"  
✅ **Camera activation works** - "Camera enabled for local player"  
✅ **Code unchanged** - Identical movement commands  
✅ **Server restarts attempted** - No longer fixes the issue  

## Key Differences to Investigate

### 1. World Data State
- **Working**: Unknown tile count
- **Current**: 186-187 tiles
- **File**: `user://world_data.tres`
- **Changes**: Frequent "WorldManager: Detected tilemap changes" messages

### 2. Client Slot Numbers  
- **Working**: Low client slot numbers
- **Current**: Slot 137+ (indicates 120+ connection attempts)
- **Hypothesis**: State corruption after many connections

### 3. Player Authority Chain
- **Critical Path**: `is_local_player` flag must be true for movement
- **Authority Setting**: `player.set_multiplayer_authority(peer_id)`  
- **Input Processing**: Only local players call `_handle_player_input()`

### 4. Input System State
- **Commands Used**: `Input.action_press("ui_right")`
- **Expected Chain**: Input → `Input.get_axis()` → `velocity.x` → `move_and_slide()`
- **Failure Point**: Unknown

## Investigation Plan

### Phase 1: State Comparison
- [ ] Check current vs working `world_data.tres`
- [ ] Verify `is_local_player` flag status
- [ ] Test with fresh user data directory

### Phase 2: Authority Investigation  
- [ ] Verify multiplayer authority assignment
- [ ] Check `_handle_player_input()` execution
- [ ] Test direct velocity manipulation

### Phase 3: Input System Analysis
- [ ] Verify `Input.get_axis()` return values
- [ ] Test input actions individually
- [ ] Check action map integrity

### Phase 4: Clean State Test
- [ ] Delete all user data
- [ ] Reset client slot counter
- [ ] Test with minimal setup

## Hypothesis Ranking

### Most Likely (High Priority)
1. **Client slot/connection limit** - System degrades after many connections
2. **World data corruption** - Persistent state affecting new clients  
3. **Multiplayer authority failure** - `is_local_player` not set correctly

### Medium Priority
4. **Input map corruption** - Action mappings broken
5. **Physics processing disabled** - Movement pipeline interrupted

### Low Priority  
6. **Godot engine bug** - State corruption in multiplayer system
7. **Memory/resource exhaustion** - Too many test connections
